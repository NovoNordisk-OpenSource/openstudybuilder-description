## Workshop at CDISC EU Interchange 

(13 May 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland with Mikkel Traun, Nicolas de Saint-Jorre and Katja Glass)

In this interactive workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience in designing a clinical study using OpenStudyBuilder, with a focus on the schedule of activities. Explore how the CDISC 360i envisioned "Design" and "Build" processes are implemented within the tool. Learn to create visits, assign activities, and export your study to USDM. Experience the rendering into an M11 protocol. Additionally, select data specifications for chosen activities, then export and review the structure definition in define.xml format. This workshop offers a practical introduction to the steps and processes, providing a first impression of how this workflow can transform clinical study development.

## CDISC EU Interchange 

(14-15 May 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland)

We will be at the CDISC EU Interchange conference in Geneva. We will do demonstrations at the COSA booth and maybe have the following presentation.

**Enhanced Biomedical Concepts: A Design Perspective in OpenStudyBuilder Supporting CDISC 360i**

This presentation provides a deep dive into the design and implementation of the activity concept within OpenStudyBuilder, showcasing its role in the broader context of clinical study automation as envisioned by CDISC 360i. We will compare OpenStudyBuilderâ€™s graph-based model with CDISC Biomedical Concepts, focusing on the rationale behind design choices, including structural adaptations and enhancements. Additionally, we will discuss challenges encountered during development, highlighting lessons learned and future opportunities to refine the approach.
