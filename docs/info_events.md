## Workshop at CDISC EU Interchange 

(13 May 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland with Mikkel Traun, Nicolas de Saint-Jorre and Katja Glass)

In this interactive workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience in designing a clinical study using OpenStudyBuilder, with a focus on the schedule of activities. Explore how the CDISC 360i envisioned "Design" and "Build" processes are implemented within the tool. Learn to create visits, assign activities, and export your study to USDM. Experience the rendering into an M11 protocol. Additionally, select data specifications for chosen activities, then export and review the structure definition in define.xml format. This workshop offers a practical introduction to the steps and processes, providing a first impression of how this workflow can transform clinical study development.

## CDISC EU Interchange 

(14-15 May 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland)

We will be at the CDISC EU Interchange conference in Geneva. We will do demonstrations at the COSA booth and maybe have the following presentation.

**Enhanced Biomedical Concepts: A Design Perspective in OpenStudyBuilder Supporting CDISC 360i**

This presentation provides a deep dive into the design and implementation of the activity concept within OpenStudyBuilder, showcasing its role in the broader context of clinical study automation as envisioned by CDISC 360i. We will compare OpenStudyBuilderâ€™s graph-based model with CDISC Biomedical Concepts, focusing on the rationale behind design choices, including structural adaptations and enhancements. Additionally, we will discuss challenges encountered during development, highlighting lessons learned and future opportunities to refine the approach.

## CDISC 360i Working Group at CDISC EU Interchange 

(16 May 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland)

For those interested in being part of the 360i transformative program, a working group session will run from 8:30 am until 2:30 pm on the Friday immediately after the Interchange. This working session, open to both current participants and those interested in joining the 360i transformative program, provides an exceptional opportunity to collaborate with CDISC leaders and other key stakeholders.

The session is designed to foster meaningful discussion and hands-on contributions to shape the future of standards development and implementation. We encourage you to include this event in your travel plans and take advantage of this chance to engage with industry leaders, share your insights, and drive transformative change alongside other experts.

OpenStudyBuilder will be highly involved in the CDISC 360i Working Group and related processes. For this part of our team will join this meeting and we can recomment to join this session.
